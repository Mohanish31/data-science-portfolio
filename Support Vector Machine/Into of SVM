SVM - Support vector machine.
It belong to supervised machine learning algo
It is an algo to classify Object 
Application :
            1. Face detection 
            2. Classification of images
            3.Handwriting recongition
            4. Bio informatics
Topologies:
          1. Input/output
          2. A line(hyperplane) which seprates class
          3. A threshold value 
          4. Margin
          5. Soft margin
          6. Support vector 
          7. Kernal
Methods: Bias -variance tradeoff Concept  and cross validation

Algo:
1. SVM will generates hyperplane iteratively that segregate the class in best way.
2. It will chosse the hyperplane that separates the class correctly

Note: Star and dot are two different classes and between them there are three line two dashed and one solid line , solid line is hyperplane
now support vector datapoints are on the dashed lineand distance between dashed line and solid line is margin .. 

Lets insert a dataset (linear data) to see what it will do and what tuning we have to perform to get the result

How it work:
1.Only and only thing we are doing here is to find the best line which can fit in between classes to classify class A and class B
2. How to get the best fit line ? we need a threshold value to get the best fit line threshold value define where the line(hyperplane) will draw
3. lets calulate the shortest distance between the neariest Class A data point and Class B data point then we take a mid point to draw a threshold
4. and the shortes distance between observation and threshold is called margin and to get the correct threshold value we use bias-variance tradeoff
5. Now hat happen when we have miss classified datapoint instead of ignoring or removing the missclassied datapoints we use them.
6. the distance between the observation and missclassified datapoint is called soft margin . now we need to find the correct threshold to allow missclassification as well
7. By cross-validation
