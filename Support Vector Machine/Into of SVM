SVM - support vector machine.
It belongs to a supervised machine learning algorithm
It is an algorithm to classify Object 
Application :
            1. Face detection 
            2. Classification of images
            3. Handwriting recognition
            4. Bioinformatics
Topologies:
          1. Input/output
          2. A line(hyperplane) which separates class
          3. A threshold value 
          4. Margin
          5. Soft margin
          6. Support vector 
          7. Kernal
Methods: Bias -variance tradeoff Concept  and cross-validation

Algo:
1. SVM will generate hyperplane iteratively that segregates the class in the best way.
2. It will choose the hyperplane that separates the class correctly

Note: Star and dot are two different classes and between them, there are three lines two dashed and one solid line, the solid line is a hyperplane
now support vector data points are on the dashed line and distance between dashed line and solid line is a margin... 

Let's insert a dataset (linear data) to see what it will do and what tuning we have to perform to get the result

How it works:
1. Only and the only thing we are doing here is to find the best line which can fit in between classes to classify class A and class B
2. How to get the best fit line ? we need a threshold value to get the best fit line threshold value to define where the line(hyperplane) will draw
3. let's calculate the shortest distance between the nearest Class A data point and Class B data point then we take a midpoint to draw a threshold
4. and the shortest distance between observation and threshold is called margin and to get the correct threshold value we use bias-variance tradeoff
5. Now hat happens when we have miss classified data point instead of ignoring or removing the misclassified data points we use them.
6. the distance between the observation and misclassified datapoint is called soft margin. now we need to find the correct threshold to allow misclassification as well
7. By cross-validation
